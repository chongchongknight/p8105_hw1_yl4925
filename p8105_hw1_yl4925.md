## Problem1

Library the package we need

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──

    ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
    ## ✓ tibble  3.1.4     ✓ dplyr   1.0.7
    ## ✓ tidyr   1.1.3     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✓ readr   2.0.1     ✓ forcats 0.5.1

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

Create dataframe

``` r
solution_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0, 
  vec_char =  c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("NY", "NY", "NY", "NY", "CA", "CA", "CA", "FL", "FL", "FL"))
)
```

Calculate mean for each variable

``` r
numeric_mean = mean(pull(solution_df, var = 1))
logical_mean = mean(pull(solution_df, var = 2))
char_mean = mean(pull(solution_df, var = 3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(solution_df, var = 3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
factor_mean = mean(pull(solution_df, var = -1))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(solution_df, var = -1)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

We find mean function works for vec\_numeric and vec\_logical, and
doesn’t work for vec\_char and vec\_factor

Then we use the as.numeric function to variable.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(solution_df, var = 2))
as.numeric(pull(solution_df, var = 3))
as.numeric(pull(solution_df, var = -1))
mean(as.numeric(pull(solution_df, var = 2)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(solution_df, var = -1)))
```

We notice that both logical and factor variable are successfully convert
to numeric, and we can use mean() function on the converted factor
variable. But char variable fail to be converted. I think the reason is
that both logical and factor variable have category or rank while char
variable doesn’t. And in my dataframe, the conversion of factor
variables into numbers is realized in the order of the letters. But
difference between conversion doesn’t explain what happens when we take
mean. I mean that although factor variables can be grouped and sorted,
they are non-numerical variables and we can not use mean() function on
them.

## Problem2

Load the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
row_size = nrow(penguins)
column_size = ncol(penguins)
modified_penguins = drop_na(penguins, flipper_length_mm)
mean_flipper = mean(pull(modified_penguins, var = 5))
```

Speices variable indicates the speice of penguins, island variable
indicates the place penguins lived in, bill\_length\_mm variable
indicates the length of penguin’s beak measured in millimeters,
bill\_depth\_mm variable indicates the depth of penguin’s beak measured
in millimeters, flipper\_length\_mm variable indicates the length of
penguin’s front wing measured in millimeters, body\_mass\_g variable
indicates weight of penguin measured in gram, sex variable shows the
gender of penguin and year variable shows that when above data were
recorded.

The row size for penguins dataframe is 344, and the column size for
penguins dataframe is 8. The mean of penguins’ flipper length is
200.9152047millimeters.

Scatterplot of flipper\_length\_mm vs bill\_length\_mm:

``` r
ggplot(modified_penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species))
```

``` r

```
